<div><p>Don&#8217;t you hate finding out you&#8217;ve been deceived by something cool?</p>
<p>So, back in January I posted <a href="http://blog.humanmade.org/post/72118026/joshua-klein-on-the-intelligence-of-crows-video">this TED Talk from Joshua Klein</a> about his work with crows.</p>
<p>The NYTimes had a story about this (Klein, not my posting), which seemed to back up how cool Mr. Klein and his work was.</p>
<p>Seems a lot of his research wasn&#8217;t all there. The NYTimes put up<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/magazine/12letters-t-CORRECTIONS-1.html">a Corrections piece</a> about their story; it seemed worth while to share it here.</p></div>
