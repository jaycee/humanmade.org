<div><p>If a body is what you want,<br /> then here is bone and gristle and flesh. <br />   Here is the clavicle-snapped wish, <br />   the aorta&#8217;s opened valves, the leap <br />   thought makes at the synaptic gap. <br />   Here is the adrenaline rush you crave, <br />   that inexorable fight, that insane puncture <br />   into heat and blood. And I dare you to finish <br />   what you&#8217;ve started. Because here, Bullet, <br />   here is where I complete the word you bring <br />   hissing through the air, here is where I moan <br />   the barrel&#8217;s cold esophagus, triggering <br />   my tongue&#8217;s explosives for the rifling I have <br />   inside of me, each twist of the round <br />   spun deeper, because here, Bullet, <br />   here is where the world ends, every time.      <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2008/04/18/DI2008041802196.html?hpid=features1">From the Post</a></p></div>
