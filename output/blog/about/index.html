<div><h3>Me</h3>
<p>Bios are a pain.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a programmer in Durham, NC. Right now I&#8217;m professionally (as in I get paid to) working on NLP products and testing products for a psychometrics firm. Additionally I do whatever random code monkey stuff I&#8217;m asked to do. It&#8217;s a living. But I&#8217;d rather work for myself (or some decently interesting startup).</p>
<p>In my own time, I&#8217;m pursuing projects in organizing collective action, saving money, reading online, and community discovery tools.</p>
<p>I also write fiction, and would love to one day be a professional on that end too.</p>
<h3>This Blog</h3>
<p>Humanmade is my little corner of the web. It&#8217;s powered by tumblr, and about 75% of the content reflects that. The rest consists of my musings on various topics of interest, largely programming; at this point in time that boils down to mostly python/django development.</p></div>
