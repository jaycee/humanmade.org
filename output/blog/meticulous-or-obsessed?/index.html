<div><p><a href="http://blog.nodnod.net/post/322134926/theres-been-a-relatively-unfortunate-trend">DZ</a>  commented on my <a href="http://blog.humanmade.org/post/322042007/theres-a-great-little-blog-called-minimal-mac">previous post</a> regarding an unfortunate use of an MLK quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s been a relatively unfortunate trend recently of idolizing the ridiculously obsessed. Obsessives, in some circles, equate automatically to quality and workmanship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem here, I think, is that obsession becomes an easy stand in for meticulousness. It&#8217;s an understandable mistake to make, honestly. An artist or craftsman who is meticulous in the details of of their art or craft is generally obsessed; the focus of that obsession is however about something deeper than the number of icons on one&#8217;s desktop.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean that a person&#8217;s obsessions are necessarily trivial&#8212;when John Gruber and Merlin Mann asked people to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/03/obsession_times_voice">&#8220;pursue their obsessions in a serious way&#8221;</a> I agreed with them along with most of the people in the world blogging. But to me, pursuing an obsession in a meaningful way means having some perspective.</p>
<p>Be meticulous in your pursuits&#8212;save obsession for the things that matter.</p></div>
