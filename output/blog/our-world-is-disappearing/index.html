<div><p>&#8230;not in the literal sense, but in the historical. None of the mediums we&#8217;re using for storage (or at least none we were using from moon-landing era on till about 5 years ago) are terribly stable long term. So historically, in a few centuries, this period won&#8217;t exist. There won&#8217;t be any real evidence of it, beyond suspect secondary sources.</p><p>Â Which means, in a future space, you&#8217;ve got the possibility of a geniunely amnesiac society. </p></div>
