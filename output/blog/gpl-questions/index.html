<div><p>I&#8217;m looking into a project that can be most easily accomplished via a component that is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>.</p>
<p>This means I get to join the large group of people wondering just what the bounds of the GPL are.</p>
<ul><li>If I modify the component, and redistribute it, I have to release my mods under GPL.</li>
<li>If I modify the component, but it&#8217;s only used via http access by some client, and I distribute the client, does the client have to be GPLed? What about the modified component? Does it count as distribution?</li>
<li>If I don&#8217;t modify the component, and it&#8217;s only used via http access by some client, and I distribute the client, does the client have to be GPLed? What about the modified component? Does it count as distribution?</li>
</ul><p>My feelings (and assumptions) are that the second and third cases do not require the modified component to be GPLed nor the client. But I don&#8217;t really know, and the language doesn&#8217;t make it clear.</p></div>
