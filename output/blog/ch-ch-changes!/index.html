<div><p>For the longest time, this has served as a feed of my del.icio.us links, my twitter feed, my flickr feed, my lj feed, and so forth. But I&#8217;ve shed lj, and the rest has all gone over to friendfeed, which does a far better job of it all. So from here on in, until I find something better, this has become my blog.</p>
<p>Enjoy the future posts.</p></div>
